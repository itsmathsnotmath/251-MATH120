% This is a LaTeX file.  It is a text file that is compiled    %
% by a program called LaTeX into a pretty PDF file.            %
% If you're viewing this file on Overleaf,                     %

% The LaTeX macro language is complicated, so we have inserted %
% lots of documenting comments into the file.  Comments start  %
% with `%' and continue to the end of the line.                %

% The following are the instructions and guidelines for the polished proof. You should leave these alone and, after reading them, proceed to the problems.

\section*{Polished Proof Instructions}

\begin{itemize}
    \item These are to be written up in \LaTeX{} and turned in on Gradescope.
    \item \href{https://bit.ly/3TJfkTp}{\textbf{Click here to duplicate this \texttt{.tex} file in Overleaf}}.
    \item Some tutorials on how to use \LaTeX{} can be found \href{https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Tutorials}{\underline{here}}. If you have any questions about \LaTeX{} commands you can always ask your instructor for advice.
    \item This polished proof assignment contains two problems and a reflection. Choose \textbf{one} problem to complete and submit for grading, and complete the reflection based on the given prompts.
    \item Polished proofs are held to a higher standard than regular assignments and exams. You are given two chances to submit this proof: a first draft that will be scrutinised and given back with detailed feedback on how to make the proof ``polished'', and a second (final) draft where you will take on board the feedback of the first draft and make improvements to your proof.
    \item This is the second and final draft of the assignment.
    \item The score of the assignment is out of 15 marks: 9 come from the \href{https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YZhhGv5OyPdx0-VDa6i6cftkzPromMRY/view?usp=drive_link}{\textbf{RVF rubric}}, 3 points are given for the proper use of \LaTeX{} and the remaining 3 points are for a reflection of the assignment.
    \item Your final score for the polished proof will be the maximum of the score of the first draft and the average of the scores of both drafts.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Statement on generative AI}

In this and other mathematics courses, you are expected to construct clear and concise mathematical arguments based on statements proven in our text and class notes. Large language models such as ChatGPT are unable to produce this kind of solution. They also frequently generate circular logic and outright false results.
 
You may use AI to summarise content, generate study plans, create problems, or do other study-related activities. You may not ask a chatbot to solve your quiz or homework problems, or do any assessment-related activities.
 
You may use AI tools to edit your grammar and punctuation, but remember that mathematical English is not the same as academic English in other disciplines.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section*{Proof Options}

Choose \textbf{one} of the following proofs to complete and submit for grading.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Let $n$ be an integer. Prove that there exist integers $x$ and $y$ such that $n=6x+4y$ if and only if $n$ is divisible by $2$.
    \item Let $n$ be an integer. Prove that there exists an integer $x$ such that $n=3x-1$ if and only if there exists an integer $y$ such that $n=3y+5$.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent You must explain every step of your proof. You may quote and use definitions and results from Sections 1--12 of the textbook or Appendix D, as long as you reference them appropriately.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section*{Reflection Instructions}

Provide at least a paragraph explaining your process for completing the proof you have chosen above. You may use the following prompts to guide your response and any additional information needed to support your reflection. Responses consisting of one sentence or less for each of the following prompts will not be acceptable.

\begin{itemize}
    \item What did you realise worked and/or didn't work for your first draft?
    \item How did you change/adjust your strategy this time?
    \item Compared to your first draft, what stayed the same and what is different for the final draft?
    \item Have you identified a type of mistake you might be particularly prone to? If so, how do you think you'll try to catch yourself making that mistake in the future?
    \item Is there anthing else you've learnt or improved by doing this assignment?
\end{itemize}
