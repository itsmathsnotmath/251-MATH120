% This is a LaTeX file.  It is a text file that is compiled    %
% by a program called LaTeX into a pretty PDF file.            %
% If you're viewing this file on Overleaf,                     %
% you'll see that PDF in the window to the right.              %

% The LaTeX macro language is complicated, so we have inserted %
% lots of documenting comments into the file.  Comments start  %
% with `%' and continue to the end of the line.                %
%                                                              %
% Boxed comments are provided to let you, the student,         %
% understand what that part of the code is doing or to provide %
% you with instructions.                                       %

\section*{Statement on generative AI}

In this and other math courses, you are expected to construct clear and concise mathematical arguments based on statements proven in our text and class notes. Large language models such as ChatGPT are unable to produce this kind of solution. They also frequently generate circular logic and outright false results.
 
You may use AI to summarize content, generate study plans, create problems, or do other study-related activities. You may not ask a chatbot to solve your quiz or homework problems, or do any assessment-related activities.
 
You may use AI tools to edit your grammar and punctuation, but remember that mathematical English is not the same as academic English in other disciplines.
