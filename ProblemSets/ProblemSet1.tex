    \item Write your solutions inside the \texttt{solution} environment.
    \item You are always encouraged to talk problems through with your peers and your instructor, but your write up should be done independently.
    \item Problems are graded on correctness and fluency.
    \item Some tutorials on how to use \LaTeX{} can be found \href{https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Tutorials}{\underline{here}}. If you have any questions about \LaTeX{} commands you can always ask your instructor for advice.

\section*{Statement on generative AI}

In this and other mathematics courses, you are expected to construct clear and concise mathematical arguments based on statements proven in our text and class notes. Large language models such as ChatGPT are unable to produce this kind of solution. They also frequently generate circular logic and outright false results.
 
You may use AI to summarise content, generate study plans, create problems, or do other study-related activities. You may not ask a chatbot to solve your quiz or homework problems, or do any assessment-related activities.
 
You may use AI tools to edit your grammar and punctuation, but remember that mathematical English is not the same as academic English in other disciplines.

\section*{Problem 1}

Consider the following.

\begin{definition}
    An integer $n$ is called a \emph{perfect square} if there exists an integer $k$ such that $n=k^2$.
\end{definition}
\begin{theorem}
    There exists a non-zero perfect square that can be written as the sum of two other non-zero perfect squares.
\end{theorem}

Suppose $n$ is a non-zero perfect square. Using only the information given above, which of the following conclusions are valid? Explain why or why not.

\begin{enumerate}[a)] % The enumerate environment produces a numbered list of items. The [a)] ensures that the items are labelled with letters instead.
    \item There exists two non-zero perfect squares $a$ and $b$ such that $a+b=n$.

    \item There exists another non-zero perfect square $m$ such that $n+m$ is a perfect square.

Without changing their meanings, write the following statements as if-then statements. Then decide if the statements are true or false. (You don't need to justify why they are true or false).

\begin{enumerate}[a)] % The enumerate environment produces a numbered list of items. The [a)] ensures that the items are labelled with letters instead.
    \item An integer is divisible by $3$ only if it is odd.

    \item Three consecutive odd integers cannot be all prime.

Give a reason as to why each of the following statements are false.

\begin{enumerate}[a)] % The enumerate environment produces a numbered list of items. The [a)] ensures that the items are labelled with letters instead.
    \item There exists an integer $n$ such that $n^2-1$ is prime.

\section*{Problem 4}

The following claim is true, but the given proof contains a flaw, making it invalid. Find the flaw and fix the proof so that it is valid.

    \begin{claim}
        The difference between any odd integer and any even integer is odd.
    \end{claim}
    \begin{proof}
        Suppose $n$ is an odd integer and $m$ is an even integer. By the definition of odd, $n=2k+1$ where $k$ is an integer, and by the definition of even $m=2k$ where $k$ is an integer. Then $$n-m=\left(2k+1\right)-2k=1.$$ Since $1$ is odd, the claim is true.

\section*{Problem 5}

The following claim and its proof are poorly written. They are both missing important information. Explain why both the claim and its proof are poorly written, then revise both the claim and proof so that any student in this course will understand it.

\begin{claim}
    If $x^2\neq0$ then $x^2>0$
\end{claim}
\begin{proof}
    If $x>0$, then $x^2=xx>0$. If $x<0$, then $-x>0$, so $\left(-x\right)\left(-x\right)>0$. i.e., $x^2>0$.

Consider the following definitions.

\begin{definition}
    An integer is \emph{alphic} if $n=4k+1$ for some integer $k$.

\begin{definition}
    An integer is \emph{gammic} if $n=4k+3$ for some integer $k$.

\begin{enumerate}[a)] % enumerate produces a numbered list of items. The [a)] ensures that the items are labelled with letters instead.

    \item Give an example of an alphic integer and explain why it is alphic.

    \item Explain whether the following statement is true: ``If $6$ is alphic, then $8$ is gammic.''

    \item Prove that if $x$ is alphic and $y$ is gammic, then $x-y$ is even.

\section*{Problem 9}

For each of the following claims, an attempt to disprove the statement is given. For each one, explain why the argument given is invalid. Then, give an argument that either proves or disproves the claim.

\begin{enumerate}[a)] % The enumerate environment produces a numbered list of items. The [a)] ensures that the items are labelled with letters instead.
    \item ~\vspace{-19pt}
    \begin{claim}
        If $n$ is divisible by $4$ then $3n+2$ is divisible by $6$.
    \end{claim}
    \begin{proof}
        Let $n=6$. Then $3\cdot 6+2=20$ and $20$ is not divisible by $6$. Thus the claim is false.
    \end{proof}
    
    \item ~\vspace{-19pt}
    \begin{claim}
         Every composite integer $n$ is divisible by either $2$ or $3$.
    \end{claim}
    \begin{proof}
        Let $n=1$. Then $2\not|~ 1$ and $3\not|~1$. Thus the claim is false.
    \end{proof}

    \item ~\vspace{-19pt}
    \begin{claim}
        If $n$ is an integer such that $n^2+4n+2$ is prime, then $n$ is odd.
    \end{claim}
    \begin{proof}
        Let $n=9$. Then $n$ is odd but $9^2+4\left(9\right)+2=119=7\cdot17$ is composite. Thus the claim is false.
    \end{proof}
