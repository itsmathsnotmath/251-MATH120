    \item These are to be written up in \LaTeX{} and turned in on Gradescope.
    \item \href{https://bit.ly/3Tb7ZMc}{\textbf{Click here to duplicate this \texttt{.tex} file in Overleaf}}.
    \item Write your solutions inside the \texttt{solution} environment.
    \item You are always encouraged to talk problems through with your peers and your instructor, but your write up should be done independently.
    \item Problems are graded on correctness and fluency.
    \item Unless stated otherwise, all calculations require justification.
    \item Some tutorials on how to use \LaTeX{} can be found \href{https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Tutorials}{\underline{here}}. If you have any questions about \LaTeX{} commands you can always ask your instructor for advice.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Statement on generative AI}

In this and other mathematics courses, you are expected to construct clear and concise mathematical arguments based on statements proven in our text and class notes. Large language models such as ChatGPT are unable to produce this kind of solution. They also frequently generate circular logic and outright false results.
 
You may use AI to summarise content, generate study plans, create problems, or do other study-related activities. You may not ask a chatbot to solve your quiz or homework problems, or do any assessment-related activities.
 
You may use AI tools to edit your grammar and punctuation, but remember that mathematical English is not the same as academic English in other disciplines.

    \begin{enumerate}[i.] % The enumerate environment produces a numbered list of items. The [a)] ensures that the items are labelled with Roman numerals instead.
        \item None of the perfect squares are prime numbers.
        \item The number $3$ is a prime number that is not even.
        \item If you take all of the prime numbers, all of the even numbers, all of the perfect squares and all of the multiples of $10$, you still won't have all of the natural numbers.

\section*{Problem 3}
For each of the following statements, describe it in English and say if is true or false (without proof). Then write its negation using quantifiers and describe this negation in English. \medskip

\noindent For example: The statement $\forall x\in\mathbb{Z},x<0$ means every integer is negative, and it is false. Its negation is $\exists x\in\mathbb{Z},x\geq 0$, which means that there exists a nonnegative integer.

\begin{enumerate}[a)] % The enumerate environment produces a numbered list of items. The [a)] ensures that the items are labelled with Roman numerals instead.
    \item $\forall x\in\mathbb{Z},~\exists y\in\mathbb{Z},~x^2+y=4$

Proposition 12.4 of the textbook says that for any finite sets $X$ and $Y$, we have $$\left|X\right|+\left|Y\right|=\left|X\cup Y\right|+\left|X\cap Y\right|.$$ Use this proposition to show that for any three finite sets $A$, $B$ and $C$ that $$\left|A\cup B\cup C\right|=\left|A\right|+\left|B\right|+\left|C\right|-\left|A\cap B\right|+\left|A\cap C\right|-\left|B\cap C\right|+\left|A\cap B\cap C\right|.$$

\section*{Problem 8}
The \emph{Fibonacci numbers} are a sequence of integers $\left(f_n\right)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ defined recursively by $$f_0=1,\quad f_1=1, \quad f_n=f_{n-1}+f_{n-2}\text{ for }n\geq2.$$ The sequence begins $1,1,2,3,5,8,13,\dots$. \bigskip

\noindent Consider the following question: How many different ways are there to tile a $1\times n$ board using only square ($1\times 1$) and domino ($1\times 2$) tiles?
\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}
        \def\n{4}

\noindent As it turns out, the number of different ways to tile a $1\times n$ board using only square and domino tiles is $f_n$! 
\begin{proposition}
    For any positive integer $n$, the number of ways to tile a $1\times n$ using only square and domino tiles is $f_n$, the $n^{\text{th}}$ Fibonacci number.
\end{proposition}

\bigskip

\noindent Use this setting (and the above proposition) to come up with a combinatorial proof of the identity $$f_{2n}=\left(f_n\right)^2+\left(f_{n-1}\right)^2.$$ You may not manipulate the question algebraically. Only a combinatorial proof will be accepted. \bigskip

\noindent \emph{Hint: For the hard side of the identity, consider the tile that is covering the $n^\text{th}$ square.}
