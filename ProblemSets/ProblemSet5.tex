% This is a LaTeX file.  It is a text file that is compiled    %
% by a program called LaTeX into a pretty PDF file.            %
% If you're viewing this file on Overleaf,                     %
% you'll see that PDF in the window to the right.              %

% The LaTeX macro language is complicated, so we have inserted %
% lots of documenting comments into the file.  Comments start  %
% with `%' and continue to the end of the line.                %

% Comments are provided to let you, the student, understand    %
% what that part of the code is doing or to provide you with   %
% instructions.                                                %

\usepackage{amsmath, amsthm, amsfonts} % These packages contain most of the commands needed to format the maths symbols.
\usepackage{enumerate} % Package that contains options for the \begin{enumerate} environment.
\usepackage{hyperref} % Package that allows hyperlinks.
\newtheorem*{theorem}{Theorem} % Defines an environment with the heading "Theorem". The * supresses the numbering.
\newtheorem*{claim}{Claim} % Defines an environment with the heading "Claim". The * supresses the numbering.
\theoremstyle{definition}
\newtheorem*{definition}{Definition} % Defines an environment with the heading "Definition". The * supresses the numbering.
\newenvironment{solution}{\bigskip\hrule{\hfill}}{\bigskip\hrule{\hfill}} % Defines an environment that draws lines to make clear where your solution starts and ends.

% The following are the asignment instructions. You should leave these alone and, after reading them, proceed to the problems.
\section*{Assignment Instructions}

\begin{itemize}
    \item These are to be written up in \LaTeX{} and turned in on Gradescope.
    \item \href{https://bit.ly/4gawLpI}{\textbf{Duplicate this \texttt{.tex} file in Overleaf}}.
    \item Write your solutions inside the \texttt{solution} environment.
    \item You are always encouraged to talk problems through with your peers and your instructor, but your write up should be done independently.
    \item Problems are graded on correctness and fluency.
    \item Some tutorials on how to use \LaTeX{} can be found \href{https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Tutorials}{\underline{here}}. If you have any questions about \LaTeX{} commands you can always ask your instructor for advice.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Statement on generative AI}

In this and other mathematics courses, you are expected to construct clear and concise mathematical arguments based on statements proven in our text and class notes. Large language models such as ChatGPT are unable to produce this kind of solution. They also frequently generate circular logic and outright false results.
 
You may use AI to summarise content, generate study plans, create problems, or do other study-related activities. You may not ask a chatbot to solve your quiz or homework problems, or do any assessment-related activities.
 
You may use AI tools to edit your grammar and punctuation, but remember that mathematical English is not the same as academic English in other disciplines.
