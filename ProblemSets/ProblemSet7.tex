\section*{Assignment Instructions}

\begin{itemize}
    \item These are to be written up in \LaTeX{} and turned in on Gradescope.
    \item \href{https://bit.ly/3yXgVOl}{\textbf{Click here to duplicate this \texttt{.tex} file in Overleaf}}.
    \item Write your solutions inside the \texttt{solution} environment.
    \item You are always encouraged to talk problems through with your peers and your instructor, but your write up should be done independently.
    \item Problems are graded on correctness and fluency.
    \item Unless stated otherwise, all calculations require justification.
    \item Some tutorials on how to use \LaTeX{} can be found \href{https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Tutorials}{\underline{here}}. If you have any questions about \LaTeX{} commands you can always ask your instructor for advice.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Statement on generative AI}

In this and other mathematics courses, you are expected to construct clear and concise mathematical arguments based on statements proven in our text and class notes. Large language models such as ChatGPT are unable to produce this kind of solution. They also frequently generate circular logic and outright false results.
 
You may use AI to summarise content, generate study plans, create problems, or do other study-related activities. You may not ask a chatbot to solve your quiz or homework problems, or do any assessment-related activities.
 
You may use AI tools to edit your grammar and punctuation, but remember that mathematical English is not the same as academic English in other disciplines.

A fair coin is flipped $10$ times.
\begin{enumerate}[a)] % The enumerate environment produces a numbered list of items. The [a)] ensures that the items are labelled with letters instead.
    \item What is the probability that there are an equal number of heads and tails?

    \item What is the probability that there are an equal number of heads and tails \emph{and} the first three flips are heads?
    \item What is the probability that there are an equal number of heads and tails \emph{or} the first three flips are heads? 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[] For clarity, when we say $A$ \emph{or} $B$, this always includes the outcome where both events occur.

\section*{Problem 2}

An unfair coin shows heads with probability $p$ and tails with probability $1-p$. Suppose this coin is flipped $2$ times. Let $A$ be the event that the coin comes up heads first and tails second. Let $B$ be the event that the coin comes up tails first and heads second.

Suppose that $A$ and $B$ are events in a sample space $\left(S,P\right)$. Prove or disprove:

Provide an alternative proof to Proposition $31.7$ using any of the statements in Proposition $31.8$.

\begin{proposition}[31.7]
    Let $A$ and $B$ be events in a sample space $\left(S,P\right)$. Then $$P\left(A\right)+P\left(B\right)=P\left(A\cup B\right)+P\left(A\cap B\right).$$
\end{proposition}
\begin{proposition}[31.8]
    Let $\left(S,P\right)$ be a sample space and let $A$ and $B$ be events. We have the following:
\begin{enumerate}[(1)] % The enumerate environment produces a numbered list of items. The [(1)] ensures that the items are labelled with numbers contained in parenthesis.
        \item If $A\cap B=\emptyset$, then $P\left(A\cup B\right)=P\left(A\right)+P\left(B\right)$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section*{Problem 6}

Suppose we have $n$ identical tiles numbered $1,2,\dots n$ in a bag and we draw all of the tiles out, one at a time, without replacement. Let $X$ be a random variable that gives the number of tiles for which the number on the tile is larger than the number on the tiles drawn before it. \medskip

For example, if $n=4$ and we drew the tiles in the order $4,2,1,3$, then $X=1$ because only the first tile's number is larger than all of tile numbers before it. If we drew the tiles in the order $3,1,2,4$, then $X=2$ because $3$ and $4$ have numbers larger than all of the ones that came before them. \medskip

Prove that $E\left(X\right)=1+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}+\cdots+\frac{1}{n}$. \medskip

\emph{Hint: Write $X$ as the sum of simpler random variables.}
