\section*{Assignment Instructions}

\begin{itemize}
    \item These are to be written up in \LaTeX{} and turned in on Gradescope.
    \item \href{https://bit.ly/3yZ1C7Q}{\textbf{Click here to duplicate this \texttt{.tex} file in Overleaf}}.
    \item Write your solutions inside the \texttt{solution} environment.
    \item You are always encouraged to talk problems through with your peers and your instructor, but your write up should be done independently.
    \item Problems are graded on correctness and fluency.
    \item Unless stated otherwise, all calculations require justification.
    \item Some tutorials on how to use \LaTeX{} can be found \href{https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Tutorials}{\underline{here}}. If you have any questions about \LaTeX{} commands you can always ask your instructor for advice.

\section*{Statement on generative AI}

In this and other mathematics courses, you are expected to construct clear and concise mathematical arguments based on statements proven in our text and class notes. Large language models such as ChatGPT are unable to produce this kind of solution. They also frequently generate circular logic and outright false results.
 
You may use AI to summarise content, generate study plans, create problems, or do other study-related activities. You may not ask a chatbot to solve your quiz or homework problems, or do any assessment-related activities.
 
You may use AI tools to edit your grammar and punctuation, but remember that mathematical English is not the same as academic English in other disciplines.

\section*{Problem 1}
Let $G$ and $H$ be graphs. We say that $G$ is \emph{isomorphic} to $H$ if there is a bijection from $f:V\left(G\right)\longrightarrow V\left(H\right)$ such that for all $a,b\in V\left(G\right)$ we have $a\sim b$, in $G$, if and only if $f\left(a\right)\sim f\left(b\right)$, in $H$. The function $f$ is called an \emph{isomorphism} from $G$ to $H$.
    \begin{enumerate}[a)] % The enumerate environment produces a numbered list of items. The [a)] ensures that the items are labelled with letters instead.
	\item Prove that isomorphic graphs have the same number of vertices. 
	\item Prove that if $f:G\longrightarrow H$ is an isomorphism and $v\in V\left(G\right)$, then the degree of $v$ in $G$ is equal to the degree of $f\left(v\right)$ in $H$.
	\item Prove that isomorphic graphs have the same number of edges.

\section*{Problem 3}
Let $G=(V, E)$ be a graph with $V=\{v_1, v_2, \dots, v_n\}$. Its \textbf{degree sequence} is the list of degrees of its vertices, arranged in non-increasing order. That is, the degree sequence of $G$ is $(d(v_1), d(v_2), \dots, d(v_n))$ with the vertices arranged such that $d(v_1)\geq  d(v_2) \geq \dots \geq d(v_n)$. Below are different lists of possible degree sequences. Determine whether each case can be a graph with $n$ vertices. If not, explain why not. If so, describe a graph with these degrees: is the graph a complete graph, a cycle, a path, contains specific subgraphs, connected, etc?
	\begin{enumerate}[a)] % The enumerate environment produces a numbered list of items. The [a)] ensures that the items are labelled with letters instead.
		\item $n=7$ and $(6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0)$
